#### About my process

I wrote this documentation as part of a class where we set up a product team including a product owner who defined the features and designed the database, a technical writer (me) who wrote the API docs, a technical editor who verified 
that the docs were accurate and met minimum style standards, and a usability tester who verified that the documents accurately described some common use cases.

Our publishing process looked like this:

1. Gather the documentation requirements in the product backlog. Design the document set.
1. Groom the work items for the sprint backlog.
1. Write, edit, review, commit to source control, deploy to production.
1. Repeat with each product increment until the full documentation set is delivered.
1. Define maintenance tasks to be considered for future increments.

### Fleet Admin Portal User Guide

The following samples are from a larger User Guide for a cloud based UI to manage fleets of commercial vehicles. Fleet operators use the service to update vehicle software, gather driving behavior, and inspect a given vehicle's health status and software versions.

[Help Desk chapter](docs/Fleet%20Admin%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20-%20Help%20Desk.pdf) (PDF)

This sample describes a Help Desk feature that reports the health and configuration of a given vehicle. Field support staff use the Help Desk to investigate troubled vehicles. To get the screen prints for this chapter I set up an account on a staging server and used Postman to inject the data that suited my needs. I logged a couple of bugs along the way. I sent my draft out to the sprint team for a technical review, applied the feedback, converted the final version to PDF and delivered it to the customer.

[Software Package Format appendix](docs/Fleet%20Admin%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20-%20sw%20package%20format.pdf) (PDF)

When a new software version is available for a vehicle, a fleet operator uploads a software package to the fleet management system. This sample describes the very specific format that the software package must match. The test data for this section was complex; the values not only needed to be valid, they also needed to relate to each other in a realistic way that would return results that made sense. I needed several attempts before I had my data set up the way I liked it. The source document was written and reviewed in Word before finally being converted to PDF and delivered to the customer.

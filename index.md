### API reference for fleet management REST APIs

### Fleet Admin Portal User Guide

The following samples are from a larger User Guide for a cloud based UI to manage fleets of commercial vehicles. Fleet operators use the service to update vehicle software, gather driving behavior, and inspect a given vehicle's health status and software versions.

[Help Desk chapter](docs/Fleet%20Admin%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20-%20Help%20Desk.docx) (.docx)

This sample describes a Help Desk feature that reports the health and configuration of a given vehicle. Field support staff use the Help Desk to investigate troubled vehicles.

[Software Package Format appendix](docs/Fleet%20Admin%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20-%20sw%20package%20format.docx) (.docs)

When a new software version is available for a vehicle, a fleet operator uploads a software package to the fleet management system. This sample describes the very specific format that the software package must match.

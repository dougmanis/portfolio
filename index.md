### [API reference for Flexigift Service](https://dougmanis.github.io/flexigift-service/)

This is an [API specification](https://dougmanis.github.io/flexigift-service/) for the Flexigift gift card management service, a fictional product that allows users to spend their third-party gift cards directly at their Amazon.com shopping carts.

#### Tools used

+ Visual Studio Code to write the documents in Markdown.
+ GitHub, Git command line, and GitHub Desktop for code reviews and managing versions.
+ GitHub Pages with Jekyll templates to publish the documents.

#### About my process

I wrote this documentation as part of a class where we set up a product team including a product owner who defined the features and designed the database, a technical writer (me) who wrote the API docs, a technical editor who verified 
that the docs were accurate and met minimum style standards, and a usability tester who verified that the documents accurately described some common use cases.

Our publishing process looked like this:

1. Gather the documentation requirements in the product backlog. Design the document set.
1. Groom the work items for the sprint backlog.
1. Write, edit, review, commit to source control, deploy to production.
1. Repeat with each product increment until the full documentation set is delivered.
1. Define maintenance tasks to be considered for future increments.

### API reference for fleet management REST APIs



### Fleet Admin Portal User Guide

The following samples are from a larger User Guide for a cloud based UI to manage fleets of commercial vehicles. Fleet operators use the service to update vehicle software, gather driving behavior, and inspect a given vehicle's health status and software versions.

[Help Desk chapter](docs/Fleet%20Admin%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20-%20Help%20Desk.docx) (.docx)

This sample describes a Help Desk feature that reports the health and configuration of a given vehicle. Field support staff use the Help Desk to investigate troubled vehicles.

[Software Package Format appendix](docs/Fleet%20Admin%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20-%20sw%20package%20format.docx) (.docs)

When a new software version is available for a vehicle, a fleet operator uploads a software package to the fleet management system. This sample describes the very specific format that the software package must match.
